## Goal

Azure Export for Terraform exports resources that are supported by the [Terraform AzureRM provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm) into Terraform state and generate the corresponding Terraform configuration. Both the Terraform state and configuration are expected to be consistent with the resources' remote state, i.e., `terraform plan` shows no diff. The user then is able to use Terraform to manage these resources.

## Non Goal

The Terraform configurations generated by `aztfexport` are not meant to be comprehensive and do not ensure that the infrastructure can be fully reproduced from said generated configurations. For details, please see [limitations](#limitation).

## Install

### From Release

#### AUR (Linux)

```bash
yay -S aztfexport
```

## Prerequisites

`aztfexport` requires a `terraform` executable installed in the `$PATH` with version `>= v0.12`.

## How it Works

`aztfexport` leverages [`aztft`](https://github.com/magodo/aztft) to identify the Terraform resource type corresponding to an Azure resource ID. Then it runs `terraform import` under the hood to import each resource. Afterwards, it runs [`tfadd`](https://github.com/magodo/tfadd) to generate the Terraform HCL code for each imported resource.

## Usage

Read the [Azure Export documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/azure-export-for-terraform/export-terraform-overview) which covers scenarios and usage.

### Config

`aztfexport` will create a configuration file at `$HOME/.aztfexport/config.json`. This file is aim to be managed by command `aztfexport config [subcommand]`, which includes following subcommands:

- `get`: Get a config item
- `set`: Set a config item
- `show`: Show the full configuration

Currently, the following config items are supported:

- `installation_id`: A UUID created on first run. If there is Azure CLI or Azure Powershell installed on the current machine, the UUID will be the same value among these tools. Otherwise, a new one will be created. This is used as an identifier in the telemetry trace.
- `telemetry_enabled`: Enables telemetry. We use telemetry to identify issues and areas for improvement, in order to optimize this tool for better performance, reliability, and user experience. If you wish to disable our telemetry, set this to false.

## Limitations
